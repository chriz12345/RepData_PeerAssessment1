## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r} 
unzip("activity.zip")
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

An initial look at the data confirms its dimensions and contents.

```{r} 
head(activityData)
summary(activityData)
names(activityData)
str(activityData)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r} 
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityData, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r} 
hist(stepsPerDay$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total steps taken per day", 
     col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0,20), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500) )
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r} 
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay$steps)
meanStepsPerDay
```
```{r} 
medianStepsPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay$steps)
medianStepsPerDay
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r} 
stepsPerInterval<-aggregate(steps~interval, data=activityData, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(steps~interval, data=stepsPerInterval, type = "l", col="red", lwd = 2, xlab="Interval", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")
```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r} 
intervalWithMaxNbSteps <- stepsPerInterval[which.max(stepsPerInterval$steps),]$interval
intervalWithMaxNbSteps
```



## Imputing missing values

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r} 

activityDataNoNA<-activityData
for(i in 1:nrow(activityDataNoNA)){
  if(is.na(activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps)){
    activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps <- getMeanStepsPerInterval(activityDataNoNA[i,]$interval)
  }
}
```
The new data set with no missing values is contained in the variable activityDataNoNA
a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

```{r} 
totalStepsPerDayNoNA <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activityDataNoNA, sum)
hist(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)

meanStepsPerDayNoNA <- mean(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
medianStepsPerDayNoNA <- median(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


 Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
 
```{r} 
activityData$date <- as.Date(strptime(activityData$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activityData$datetype <- sapply(activityData$date, function(x) {
  if (weekdays(x) == "Sábado" | weekdays(x) =="Domingo") 
  {y <- "Weekend"} else 
  {y <- "Weekday"}
  y
})
```


plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of
steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

```{r} 

activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, activityData, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot<- ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps") +
  facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(plot)
```
